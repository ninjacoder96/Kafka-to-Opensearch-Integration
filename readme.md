### Background

I created this simple repository as some sort of the POC to really try and understand how to use opensearch with kafka and really get the feeling of familiarity




### Pre-requisites

AWS **Opensearch** (Setup)

Confluent Account


### Running locally
1. Update the application.properties file and use the correct credentials for both confluent kafka and opensearch 
2. start the spring boot application
